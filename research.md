Extended periods of hot weather are among the deadliest forms of climate hazard. Compounded with the urban heat island effect--the tendency for cities to be hotter than rural areas because of urban development and industrialization—rising global temperatures put urbanites at a unique risk. With growing urban populations, extreme heat has implications on cities’ economic vitality, livability, and health, and so for for local health experts and planners, an accurate assessment and forecast of local air temperature data is vital to better understand, predict, and mitigate extreme heat events. However, in the most vulnerable areas, no such data exists.
