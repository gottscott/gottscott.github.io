Hi, I'm Anna. I'm a graduate student in the [Atmosphere and Ocean Dynamics
and Transport Group](http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/waugh/) of the [Department of
Earth and Planetary Sciences](http://eps.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins
University](http://jhu.edu/). I also run [Baltimore Open Air](http://baltimoreopenair.github.io), an urban monitoring network measuring air quality in Baltimore, Maryland. 

I'm interested in climate dynamics and understanding the how and why of what goes on in our atmosphere. My thesis research looks at quantifying urban temperature variability and heat waves, but I've been known to dabble in projects on regional hydrology, the climate impacts of aerosols, and North African precipitation.

I'm also an advocate for urbanism, sustainability, and open source software practices.
