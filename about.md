Hi, I'm Anna. I'm the co-founder and CEO of [Troposphere Monitoring](https://www.tropospheremonitoring.com/). 
I received my PhD from the [Department of
Earth and Planetary Sciences](http://eps.jhu.edu/) at [Johns Hopkins
University](http://jhu.edu/) where I was a part of the [Atmosphere and Ocean Dynamics
and Transport Group](http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/waugh/).
I also run [Baltimore Open Air](http://baltimoreopenair.github.io), an urban monitoring network measuring air quality in Baltimore, Maryland. 

I'm interested in climate dynamics and understanding the how and why of what goes on in our atmosphere. My company develops novel techniques for atmospheric measurment, from using low-cost sensors, to developing optical detection methods. My thesis research looked at how the urban heat island effect–the tendency for cities to be hotter than rural areas–--changes during heatwaves, using observations, low-cost sensors, and models from cities around the world. I've also been known to dabble in projects on regional hydrology, the climate impacts of aerosols, and North African precipitation.

I'm also an advocate for urbanism, sustainability, and open source software and hardware practices.
